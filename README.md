# AutomationPractice
Appium and Cucumber (with JS)
Here we're trying to automate some tests for the website http://automationpractice.com/index.php running on an Android mobile

We're using Appium to send the commands to the phone (need to be installed on your desktop)

And we're using Cucumber to define the scenario 

And we're using JavaScript to create the functions and drive appium (you need to have NodeJS installed on your desktop)

When the scripts runs well, we can automate them in a Jenkins for example.
